# Licence to Yacht - A GMTK 2022 Game

## Description:
Proof-of-concept RPG designed for the GMTK 2022 game jam, which had the theme "Roll of the Dice."

The game consists of a single RPG combat encounter, in which the gimmick of the game, attacking by playing the dice game Yacht, can be experienced.
