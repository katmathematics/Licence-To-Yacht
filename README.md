# Licence to Yacht - A GMTK 2022 Game

## Description:
Proof-of-concept RPG designed for the GMTK 2022 game jam, which had the theme "Roll of the Dice."

The game consists of a single RPG combat encounter, in which the gimmick of the game, attacking by playing the dice game Yacht, can be experienced. 

Play as James Yacht, a secret agent cowboy from over yonder as he tries to take down the villainous mob boss Pierre Shorte, smuggler of loaded dice. Will James succeed or will Shorte's shady dice empire spread across the lands? Its all in the luck of the dice.
